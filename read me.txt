The model I developed is based on machine learning techniques in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Its aim is to classify emails into two categories: regular mail (Ham) and spam. Initially, a comprehensive preprocessing of the data was performed, including text cleaning, removal of common words, 
deletion of missing and duplicate values, and bias correction to ensure the categories were balanced. The textual data was then converted into a numerical representation using TF-IDF technology, so that each message is represented as a set of numerical values ​​reflecting the importance of words within the text.
The Decision Tree model was trained in its second version after data optimization, demonstrating a significant improvement in accuracy and its ability to distinguish between regular and spam messages. Subsequently, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was used as an alternative and more advanced approach,
as it is effective in handling high-dimensional textual data. The SVM model achieved higher performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-Score metrics, demonstrating its superior ability to generalize results and reduce errors, particularly in spam detection.
Based on the results, the final model can be considered a supervised learning-based text classification system that uses advanced numerical representation of texts and relies on robust algorithms capable of handling nonlinear data, making it suitable for real-world applications in email filtering systems.
